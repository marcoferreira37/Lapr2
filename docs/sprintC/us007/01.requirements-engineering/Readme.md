# US 007 

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As an unregistered user, I want to register in the system to buy, sell or rent
properties.



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Each task is characterized by having a unique reference per organization, a designation, an informal and a technical description, an estimated duration and cost as well as the its classifying task category. 


>	As long as it is not published, access to the task is exclusive to the employees of the respective organization. 



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** When an unregistered user wants to register a new account in the system, the set of parameters that are asked are the following: name, citizen card number, tax number, email, phone number, and password. Do you want any extra parameters/requirements to be asked or just the ones specified above? If so, which ones are mandatory?
>  
> **Answer:** The Owner attributes are: the name, the citizen's card number, the tax number, the address, the email address and the contact telephone number. The address of the owner is not mandatory.


> **Question:** Does the user also receive the password via email or can he choose a password when registering?
>  
> **Answer:** The owner can choose a password when registering.

> **Question:** It was previously stated that an unregistered user could do a property listing request. However, with the introduction of US007, I want to clarify and make sure that now a user needs to be registered in order to buy, sell or rent properties, or if they can still do it unregistered.
>
> **Answer:**  In Sprint B we introduce US7 and now, in US4, the owner needs to be registered in the system to submit a request for listing. You should update all artifacts to include this change.
