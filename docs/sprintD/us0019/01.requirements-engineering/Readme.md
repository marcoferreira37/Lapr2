# User Story: US019 - Divide the stores in two subsets

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a network manager, I want to divide the set of all stores into two subsets, so that the total number of properties of the stores between the two subsets is the closest possible.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

From the specifications document:

Each store in the network has a store manager, and the set of stores is managed by a store network manager.

The manager of the network intends to analyze the performance of each of the branches and the global behavior of the network on a daily basis.

From the client clarifications:

Question: Does it include only properties that are announced or does it also include properties that are pending agent approval for announcement?

Answer: Please consider properties whose purchase order was accepted. In other words, deals that were done/made.

Question: What should we do with the list? Is it only for display or are we supposed to save it?

Answer: The system should display the lists to the network manager.

Question: In US019, our team had some doubts regarding the information that is going to be analyzed. According to many MDISC teachers, we are only supposed to process the information within a CSV file chosen by the network manager. However, in the US description and acceptance criteria, there isn't any mention of this, implying that we need to use all the information that's registered in our system. This situation also applies to MATCP, seeing the regression models, according to subject teachers, also should be generated using the CSV file information. Additionally, if it is only supposed to be the CSV file information, can we ask for the file path of it?

Answer: In USs 17, 18, and 19, the network manager and the store manager should be able to explore/analyze ALL deals that are registered in the system. To develop the work required by MATCP and MDISC courses, you should have a clean/empty system, and you should load the CSV file that is already available in moodle (please the link "CSV file generated by the legacy system to be explored in US17, US18, and US19" available in moodle).

Question: Should the CSV legacy file be used as a file that has the purchase orders that were accepted and therefore be used in the US019 or does the CSV file not contain the type of deals we are looking for?

Answer: In USs 17, 18, and 19, the network manager and the store manager should be able to explore/analyze ALL deals that are registered in the system. To develop the work required by MATCP and MDISC courses, you should have a clean/empty system, and you should load the CSV file that is already available in moodle (please the link "CSV file generated by the legacy system to be explored in US17, US18, and US19" available in moodle).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

AC1: The application should implement a brute-force algorithm, an algorithm which consists of calculating all the partitions of cardinal 2 and finding out which one is the minimum for the difference of the sum of the elements of each sublist.

AC2: The algorithm should return the sublists of the partition (each sublist should contain a set of tuples with two elements each, the storeID and the number of properties managed by the store) that satisfies the stated condition and also the difference between the sums of the elements of the sublists. In the user manual, this algorithm must be written in pseudocode.

AC3: Runtime tests for variable length n input lists, with n = 3, 6, 9, â€¦, 30 (asymptotic behavior) should be performed. In each run, the number of stores should be chosen sequentially. In the user manual, the results of measuring the time of each algorithm for one/several inputs of the same size, as also the graphic of the asymptotic behavior of the execution time should be presented (use a unit of time that allows you to distinguish the running times of all tested examples). Also, it should be presented the input list, the two sublists that make up the partition, and the difference of sums, for at least one example of each input size.

AC4: Worst-case time complexity of the algorithm should be documented in the application user manual (in the annexes, where algorithms should be written in pseudocode) that must be delivered with the application.

AC5: The algorithm should show errors to the network manager when he tries to run edge cases like an introduction of a number less than 2.

AC6: If there are multiple valid partitions with the same minimum difference in the number of properties, the algorithm should return any one of those partitions as a valid solution.

AC7: The algorithm should have a time complexity that allows it to work with larger input sizes efficiently.

AC8: The application should have input validation to enter a value that is divisible by 3.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

There is a dependency on US003, since we need the admin to register a store manager, so he can work in this US.

There is a dependency on US004, since we need the owner to submit property requests so we can count them to make the division between the stores.

There is a dependency on US005, since we need stores to display a list with them.

There is a dependency on US008, since we are needing the list of properties to make the division between the stores.

There is a dependency on US010, since we need the client to place an order so the agent can accept or decline it because this US works with the properties that have already been sold or rented.

There is a dependency on US011, since we need the agent to accept or decline the order request because this US works with the properties that have already been sold or rented.
